            <p class="class2">
                My name is Oleksii Melnychuk. I was born in Odessa, Ukraine.
                Graduated from School #65. Completed education in Maritime
                College of Technical Fleet. Later graduated from Maritime
                Academy. I am occupied in transport logistics of chemical
                solutions in bulk. From 18 years old, I dream about one old
                Japanese car. It is very iconic for autoculture of the 2000s.
                Its name is Toyota Supra. It has the chassis name JZA 80. This
                car became popular because of the F&F movie. This car had more
                potential than needed for that time.

                The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota
                Sūpura) is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the
                Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. The name "supra" is
                derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass" or
                "go beyond".
            </p>

            <p class="class2">
                The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from
                1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March
                2019 and went on sale in May 2019. The styling of the original
                Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer
                and wider. Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate
                model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the
                prefix Celica and named the car Supra. Owing to the similarity
                and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the
                Supra, and vice versa. The first, second, and third generations
                of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara,
                Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the
                Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra
                is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna
                Steyr. The Supra traces much of its roots back to the 2000GT
                owing to an inline-6 layout. The first three generations were
                offered with a direct descendant of the Crown's and 2000GT's M
                engine. Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis
                code "A". Along with this name, Toyota also included its own
                logo for the Supra. It was derived from the original Celica
                logo, being blue instead of orange. This logo was used until
                January 1986 when the A70 Supra was introduced. The new logo was
                similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but
                without the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras
                until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval company
                logo. The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of its color.
                It appeared on the first two generations of the Supra because
                they were officially Toyota Celicas. The dragon logo was used
                for the Celica line until it was also discontinued.
